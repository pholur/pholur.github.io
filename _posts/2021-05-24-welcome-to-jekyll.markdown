You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

As a third-year PhD student at UCLA working on cutting-edge projects in AI/ML, I spend a lot of time conjuring crazy ideas that do not work. But in the process, I have learned a few awesome things (not always related to my field) that I want to share. This website will perhaps serve this purpose.

_The gif above represents a narrative network of important actors and their inter-actor relationships. This network is generated through an [unsupervised NLP pipeline for Knowledge Extraction](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42001-020-00086-5). The pipeline is oriented toward conspiracy theories. The colors represent the estimation of different communities of actors. Such networks inform people who witness theories on different mediums of additional structured context to judge the theories' veracity and curtail the spread of misinformation._

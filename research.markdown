[Code Base @ OSF](https://osf.io/ym7aq/) <br/>
_Royal Society Open Science (under review)_ <br />
*We develop a suite of novel NLP tools that comprise semi-supervised event sequencing and impressions' extraction from Book reviews from on Goodreads.com.*

[__Conspiracy in the time of corona: automatic detection of emerging COVID-19 conspiracy theories in social media and the news__](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42001-020-00086-5) <br/>

[Code Base @ GitHub](https://github.com/Roychowdhury-group/FENESTRA-Fake-News-Structure-and-Threat-Assessment) <br/>
_Journal of Computational Social Science_ <br />
*We show how the various narrative frameworks fueling stories on the internet rely on the alignment of otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the broader reporting on the pandemic. Our processing architecture employs interlocking NLP tools to extract open information.*

[__An Automated Pipeline for Character and Relationship Extraction from Readers Literary Book Reviews on Goodreads.com__](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3394231.3397918) <br/>
_ACM WebSci' 2020_ <br />
<img align="right" width="250" height="150" src="/goodreads_icon.png">
*We develop a pipeline of interlocking automated methods to extract key characters and their relationships, and apply it to thousands of reviews and comments posted on Goodreads.com. We manually derive the ground truth narrative framework from SparkNotes, and then use word embedding tools to compare relationships in ground truth networks with our extracted networks. We find that our automated methodology generates highly accurate consensus narrative frameworks.*
